        <h3>âš¡ Optimization Techniques</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Efficient DOM Manipulation:</strong> Minimal reflows and repaints</li>
            <li><strong>CSS Optimization:</strong> Hardware-accelerated animations and transforms</li>
            <li><strong>Image Optimization:</strong> Lazy loading and responsive images</li>
            <li><strong>Code Splitting:</strong> Loading only what's needed when it's needed</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <p class="page-text">
        The application uses modern web APIs and techniques to ensure smooth 60fps animations and instant response to user interactions. Resource management is handled intelligently to prevent memory leaks and maintain consistent performance over time.

        <h3>ðŸ“Š Performance Metrics</h3>
        <p>Key performance indicators we optimize for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>First Contentful Paint (FCP) under 1.5 seconds</li>
            <li>Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) under 2.5 seconds</li>
            <li>First Input Delay (FID) under 100 milliseconds</li>
            <li>Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) under 0.1</li>
            <li>Memory usage remains stable over extended sessions</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <p class="page-text">
        By focusing on these core web vitals and performance metrics, we ensure that every user has a fast, smooth experience regardless of their device capabilities or network conditions. This commitment to performance creates a competitive advantage and improves user satisfaction.
