        <h3>ðŸŽ¨ Design Principles</h3>
        <p>Our design philosophy is built on several key principles:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Progressive Disclosure:</strong> Information is revealed gradually</li>
            <li><strong>Clear Visual Hierarchy:</strong> Important elements stand out</li>
            <li><strong>Intuitive Navigation:</strong> Users know where they are and where to go</li>
            <li><strong>Consistent Interactions:</strong> Similar actions work the same way</li>
            <li><strong>Responsive Feedback:</strong> Every action has a clear response</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <p class="page-text">
        The interface adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and input methods, ensuring a consistent experience across platforms. Whether users are on a desktop with a mouse, a tablet with touch, or a mobile device with gestures, the experience remains intuitive and engaging.
