        <p>The Kingdom of Bhutan is located in the mountainous Himalayan region northeast of modern India and south of the modern Autonomous Region of Tibet. Since its inception in 1651, Bhutan has engaged in a unique governmental effort to promote happiness for its citizens. The original approach from 1651 to the 1970s centered on Mahayana Buddhist traditions of seeking enlightenment leading to bliss and happiness.</p>

        <p>At the same time, the nature and meaning of happiness in Bhutan have evolved considerably from the seventeenth century to the present. Since the 1970s, a modern period known as <span class="highlight">Gross National Happiness (GNH)</span> has taken shape, partly grounded in Mahayana Buddhist traditions. As influential modern trends such as world trade that transcends borders, world capitalism, and urbanization have progressed, this has precipitated a deliberate effort in Bhutan through GNH to preserve ancient Buddhist happiness practices.</p>

        <p>This attempt to preserve traditional culture has also been balanced with contemporary happiness issues, like a suitable standard of living. As a result, GNH has been a guiding framework in Bhutan to further a new form of happiness in the modern era, while at the same time Bhutan has worked for greater international recognition of its approach.</p>

        <h1>Traditional Happiness in Bhutan</h1>

        <p>Ancient happiness in Bhutan began to be defined in the seventeenth century, with increasing detail in a series of official documents. In 1594, Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal, the future founder of Bhutan, was born into the Gya clan in Tibet. In 1606, the Shabdrung was anointed the eighteenth hereditary Prince-Abbot of the Brugpa Monastery at Ralung in Tibet.</p>

        <p>During this period, the Shabdrung was ranked the fifth most powerful official in the Tibetan religious and political order. However, he was exiled in 1616 due to a power struggle with an opposing Abbot – gTsang-pa. Shabdrung later fled south of Tibet to what now is modern Bhutan. Shabdrung's arrival in 1616 began the traditional interest in defining happiness in Bhutan.</p>

        <p>From the beginning of the nation of Bhutan in 1651 to the present, <span class="highlight">Mahayana Buddhism has been intricately intertwined with Bhutan's culture and politics</span>. Buddhists far and wide recognize that suffering exists as part of the human condition. The state of enlightenment, defined as "extinguishing desire," involves becoming deeply aware of (but not one with) the reality of the vast, ever-changing, and impermanent cosmos.</p>

        <h2>The Path to Enlightenment and Happiness</h2>

        <p>How can individuals attain enlightenment? That largely occurs through comprehension of the Four Noble Truths:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>The First Noble Truth</strong> is the truth that suffering exists.</li>
            <li><strong>The Second Noble Truth</strong> is understanding that suffering occurs through undue ego cravings for material things, power over others, sensuality, and failing to realize the path to enlightenment.</li>
            <li><strong>The Third Noble Truth</strong> is knowing there is a path to cease suffering.</li>
            <li><strong>The Fourth Noble Truth</strong> is the path itself, known as the Noble Eightfold Path, which provides direction on becoming enlightened, ending suffering, and being blissful and happy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Noble Eightfold Path</h3>

        <p>The Noble Eightfold Path is divided into three parts:</p>

        <p><strong>Sila</strong> includes good moral deeds and refraining from inappropriate actions of body and speech:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Right Speech</strong> – abstaining from slander and gossip that harms others</li>
            <li><strong>Right Action</strong> – not causing harm to all sentient beings</li>
            <li><strong>Right Livelihood</strong> – working in occupations that do not cause harm, pain, or injustice</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Samadhi</strong> emphasizes meditation practices to achieve enlightenment:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Right Effort</strong> – continuing meditation practices to counter undesirable mental states</li>
            <li><strong>Right Mindfulness</strong> – concentrating on what is happening in the present through meditation</li>
            <li><strong>Right Concentration</strong> – focusing the mind sharply to become more aware of cosmic reality</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Prajña</strong> offers understanding and knowledge:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Right Understanding</strong> – deep grasp of the Four Noble Truths</li>
            <li><strong>Right Thought</strong> – cultivating mental awareness that counters unwholesome ego cravings</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Early Bhutanese Governmental Promotion of Happiness</h2>

        <p>From a governmental and religious perspective, provisions for enlightenment and happiness began to be addressed in the early unwritten Constitution of Bhutan. The unwritten Constitution included several key documents:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The Nga Chudruma of 1619</li>
            <li>The Tsa Yig Chenmo of 1629</li>
            <li>The First Legal Code of 1652</li>
            <li>An updated Legal Code of 1729</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The Tsa Yig Chenmo continued after Bhutan's establishment in 1651, as a principal religious code of mandatory monastic conduct. A provision associated with happiness cites the Buddha in the Sutras:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"A king, if he is fond of Dharma (the Buddhist religious codes and teachings), finds the path to happiness both in this and in the future lives. The subjects will act as the ruler acts, and therefore should the ruler strive to learn righteousness."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h1>Modern Happiness in Bhutan</h1>

        <h2>GNH as a Strategic Goal</h2>

        <p>The early period of modern GNH in Bhutan as a strategic and broad governmental goal was launched as part of a significant political modification. Bhutan's first elected Prime Minister, the Honorable Jigme Y. Thinley, recalled the process:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"I was with His Majesty the (Fourth) King (King Jigme Singye Wangchuck) on the day of his coronation in 1974. He had ascended to the throne just two years earlier following a two-year period of mourning for the previous king, who passed away in 1972. Now I think that it was barely months thereafter that I heard him mention the term Gross National Happiness for the first time, so we are going back more than thirty years."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>The early strategic governmental purpose of GNH in Bhutan was later described by King Jigme Singye Wangchuck in two 1980 <em>New York Times</em> stories. King Wangchuck was quoted as saying:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"There is gross national product, but there is also GNH. While he is eager to improve the standard of living, he thinks there are other standards of contentment that should not be endangered by development."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>In a 1987 <em>Financial Times</em> story, King Wangchuck provided more detail:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"We are convinced that we must aim for contentment and happiness. Whether we take five years or 10 to raise the per capita income and increase prosperity is not going to guarantee that happiness, which includes political stability, social harmony, and the Bhutanese culture and way of life."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h3>The Four Pillars of GNH</h3>

        <p>Early GNH was built on four complementary and equally emphasized strategic goals, known as the four pillars:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Economic self-reliance</strong> – countering overreliance on money and wealth at the expense of the poor</li>
            <li><strong>Environmental preservation</strong> – lessening damage to the natural ecosystem because humans co-exist with other sentient life forms</li>
            <li><strong>Cultural promotion</strong> – promoting enlightenment and traditional Mahayana Buddhist values</li>
            <li><strong>Good governance</strong> – decentralizing political and administrative power within Bhutan's hereditary monarchy</li>
        </ol>

        <p>As one official explained, within Bhutanese culture, inner spiritual development is as prominent as external material development:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"Development meant enlightenment of the individual. Enlightenment is not solely an object of religious activity. Enlightenment is blossoming of happiness. It is made more probable by consciously creating a harmonious psychological, social, and economic environment."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Modern GNH and Methodological Implementation</h2>

        <p>In 2008, Bhutan adopted its first written Constitution and became a constitutional monarchy. The new Constitution required government implementation of GNH. As Article 9 states:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"The State shall strive to promote those conditions that will enable the pursuit of Gross National Happiness."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Also in 2008, the Centre for Bhutan Studies developed the <span class="highlight">Gross National Happiness Index (GNHI)</span> to quantify, operationalize, and assess government values and programs related to GNH. The original four pillars were expanded into nine quantifiable domains:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Standard of living</li>
            <li>Health</li>
            <li>Education</li>
            <li>Good governance</li>
            <li>Cultural vitality and diversity</li>
            <li>Psychological well-being</li>
            <li>Time use and balance</li>
            <li>Community vitality</li>
            <li>Ecosystem vitality</li>
        </ol>

        <p>These nine domains embody vital parts of Bhutanese national well-being and happiness. In a holistic manner, GNH is to be achieved in all domains, with no domain superior to any others.</p>

        <h1>GNH from a Global Perspective</h1>

        <p>A crucial aspect of the GNH movement has been the effort to promote greater international attention. A key step occurred on July 19, 2011, when the United Nations General Assembly approved Resolution 65/309, <em>"Happiness: Towards a Holistic Definition of Development."</em></p>

        <p>The Resolution was sponsored by Bhutan and passed without a dissenting vote. It recommended that member nations begin incorporating the primary goal of well-being and happiness into their domestic processes and policies. The Resolution stated that <span class="highlight">"the pursuit of happiness is a fundamental human goal."</span></p>

        <p>Beginning in 2012, the United Nations has issued an annual <em>World Happiness Report</em> that reviews the current state of world happiness in member nations, as well as current policy and societal issues that impact happiness around the planet.</p>

        <h1>Conclusion</h1>

        <p>Traditional happiness in early Bhutan rested on the main societal mission of wise leaders promoting the conditions for citizens to seek and become enlightened and happy. Since the mid-twentieth century, Bhutanese society has been in rapid transition, with ancient Buddhist beliefs contending with and adapting to modernization, secularization, and globalization.</p>

        <p>Key features of modern GNH since 2008 include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Buddhist modernism</strong> – GNH preserves Buddhist traditions in the face of powerful modern forces like secularization, capitalism, and urbanization</li>
            <li><strong>Holistic development</strong> – GNH is significantly more comprehensive than conventional measures like GDP, incorporating multi-dimensional social, cultural, and environmental considerations</li>
            <li><strong>Constitutional mandate</strong> – Public policymaking in Bhutan from 2008 to 2019 has substantially implemented the nine domains with no significant societal challenges</li>
            <li><strong>Global influence</strong> – Bhutan's approach has influenced international recognition of happiness as a development goal</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The meaning of modern happiness and GNH in Bhutan has been solidly grounded in both traditional and modern concepts of happiness. Where Bhutan goes in the future in advancing Buddhist modernism and happiness continues to be an unfolding story, with significant implications for international approaches to well-being and development.</p>
