            <h1 class="title">THE TRANSITION FROM EARLY TO MODERN HAPPINESS IN BHUTAN</h1>
            <div class="subtitle">Michael S. Givel</div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="content">
            <p>The Kingdom of Bhutan is located in the mountainous Himalayan region northeast of modern India and south of the modern Autonomous Region of Tibet. Since its inception in 1651, Bhutan has engaged in a unique governmental effort to promote happiness for its citizens. The original approach from 1651 to the 1970s centered on Mahayana Buddhist traditions of seeking enlightenment leading to bliss and happiness.</p>
            
            <p>At the same time, the nature and meaning of happiness in Bhutan have evolved considerably from the seventeenth century to the present. Since the 1970s, a modern period known as Gross National Happiness (GNH) has taken shape, partly grounded in Mahayana Buddhist traditions. As influential modern trends such as world trade that transcends borders, world capitalism, and urbanization have progressed, this has precipitated a deliberate effort in Bhutan through GNH to preserve ancient Buddhist happiness practices. This attempt to preserve traditional culture has also been balanced with contemporary happiness issues, like a suitable standard of living. As a result, GNH has been a guiding framework in Bhutan to further a new form of happiness in the modern era, while at the same time Bhutan has worked for greater international recognition of its approach.</p>
            
            <p>With this are two critical questions regarding the historical transformation of happiness in Bhutan. First, what is traditional happiness' direct connection to current happiness efforts in Bhutan? Furthermore, how has modern happiness in Bhutan influenced efforts for happiness worldwide? This chapter addresses these two questions using a qualitative chronological, historical, and content analysis approach. That will be accomplished by utilizing all pertinent peer-reviewed literature and research related to the historical evolution of classic happiness to modern happiness in Bhutan. Key milestones in relevant cultural and governmental development and changes involved in the transition from classic to modern Bhutanese happiness are explored causally and chronologically. Analysis also includes an overview of current happiness promotion from Bhutan to the world.</p>
            
            <div class="section-title">Traditional happiness in Bhutan</div>
            
            <p>Ancient happiness in Bhutan began to be defined in the seventeenth century, with increasing detail in a series of official documents. In 1594, Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal, the future founder of Bhutan, was born into the Gya clan in Tibet.<span class="footnote">1</span> In 1606, the Shabdrung was anointed the eighteenth hereditary Prince-Abbot of the Brugpa Monastery at Ralung in Tibet.<span class="footnote">2</span> During this period, the Shabdrung was ranked the fifth most powerful official in the Tibetan religious and political order. However, he was exiled in 1616 due to a power struggle with an opposing Abbot â€“ gTsang-pa. Shabdrung later fled south of Tibet to what now is modern Bhutan. Shabdrung's arrival in 1616 began the traditional interest in defining happiness in Bhutan.</p>
            
            <p>From the beginning of the nation of Bhutan in 1651 to the present, Mahayana Buddhism has been intricately intertwined with Bhutan's culture and politics.<span class="footnote">3</span> Buddhists far and wide recognize that suffering exists as part of the human condition. The state of enlightenment, defined as "extinguishing desire," involves becoming deeply aware of (but not one with) the reality of the vast, ever-changing, and impermanent cosmos. With this comes bliss and happiness, which is a principal goal of Buddhism. Traditional happiness in Bhutan emerged through a Buddhist dual system of government or theocracy, also known as <em>Chhoe-sid-nyi</em>. It was promoted through government and religious practices, edicts, and laws creating the condition for individuals if they chose to seek enlightenment.</p>
            
            <div class="subsection-title">The path to enlightenment and happiness</div>
            
            <p>How can individuals attain enlightenment? That largely occurs through comprehension of the Four Noble Truths. The First Noble Truth is the truth that suffering exists.<span class="footnote">4</span> The Second Noble Truth is understanding that suffering occurs through undue ego cravings for material things, power over others, sensuality, and failing to realize the path to enlightenment.<span class="footnote">5</span> The Third Noble Truth is knowing there is a path to cease suffering. That path is the Fourth Noble Truth, known as the Noble Eightfold Path. The Noble Eightfold Path provides direction on becoming enlightened, ending suffering, and being blissful and happy.<span class="footnote">6</span> The Noble Eightfold Path is divided into three parts. Sila includes good moral deeds and refraining from inappropriate actions of body and speech. Samadhi emphasizes meditation practices to achieve enlightenment. PrajÃ±a offers understanding and knowledge to being enlightened. Within Sila are Right Speech, Right Action, and Right Livelihood.<span class="footnote">7</span> Right Speech is abstaining from speech such as slander and gossip that harms others. Instead, it is important to participate in speech that aids others.<span class="footnote">8</span> Right Action is not causing harm (including criminal acts) to all sentient beings.<span class="footnote">9</span> Right Livelihood includes working in occupations that do not cause harm, pain, or injustice to sentient beings.<span class="footnote">10</span> For instance, manufacturing, selling, and promoting weapons that unduly harm others are counter to Right Livelihood.</p>
            
            <p>In Samadhi are three additional parts of the Noble Eightfold Path Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, and Right Concentration. Right effort includes continuing meditation practices to counter undesirable mental states and to become enlightened.<span class="footnote">11</span> Right Mindfulness concentrates on what is happening in the present, which is accomplished through meditation practices.<span class="footnote">12</span> That permits one to have a profound awareness of the nature of the universe and is essential to becoming enlightened. Right Concentration is the practice of focusing a mind sharply and lucidly in order to become more aware of the nature of cosmic reality.</p>
            
            <p>PrajÃ±a contains the final two parts of the Noble Eightfold Path, including Right Understanding and Right Thought. Right Understanding includes a deep grasp of the fact that the Four Noble Truths can counter suffering and lead to happiness. Right Thought includes cultivating a mental awareness that counters unwholesome ego cravings.<span class="footnote">13</span> When an individual completely practices and integrates the eight parts of the Noble Eightfold Path into their life, they are on the path to being enlightened and happy.</p>
            
            <p>A critical practice in obtaining bliss and happiness through enlightenment is karma or the law of cause and effect.<span class="footnote">14</span> When an individual engages in ongoing good actions that counter unwarranted ego craving, including compassionate acts that do not harm any sentient being, these result in Vipaka or a ripening of good karmic deeds. When a person is reborn (though there is no guarantee of being reborn as is valid with reincarnation), good karmic deeds in a past life can result in a life of greater happiness, joy, and bliss.</p>
            
            <p>Negative karma, or harmful deeds, in a lifetime due to ignorance of being enlightened, anger and hate, and undue ego craving means humans have stumbled and are destined to persist on an ever-turning Wheel of Life.<span class="footnote">15</span> Those who continue on the Wheel of Life are stuck and suffer in their current worldly existence. In a rebirth, depending on the accrual of good or bad karma in a past life, an individual can be reborn in six realms of existence. The following definitions for these six realms should not be taken literally. Instead, they are metaphorical depictions of human existence. In the three higher realms are the gods, meaning experiencing a life full of vast pleasure and happiness. Next is the realm of demi-gods in which pleasure and happiness are abundant. However, demi-gods can squabble and fight among themselves. Finally, there is the human realm in which there is suffering, including sickness, old age, hunger, and poverty.</p>
            
            <p>In the lower realm, due to bad karma, one can be reborn as an animal whose existence is principally instinctual and out of control. Further down are hungry ghosts where one is in a state of incessant seeking of undue ego cravings and desires. At the bottom of the lower realm is hell, with powerful suffering and deprivation. Only by becoming enlightened can an individual leave the Wheel of Life.</p>
            
            <div class="subsection-title">Overview of Mahayana Buddhist worldview</div>
            
            <p>The core beliefs of Mahayana Buddhism include the impermanent, unified, and non-dual cosmic universe, mitigating undue ego craving, karma, transmigration or rebirth, and becoming enlightened. Throughout the cosmic universe, impermanence is where all matter and energy are created, persists, and declines.<span class="footnote">16</span> Becoming more conscious of this reality is significant in becoming enlightened.<span class="footnote">17</span> The non-duality of reality means that all in the unified universe are related to each other. In the end, there are no binary opposites. Moreover, any dualities, like armed conflicts, are based on self-illusions. Beliefs in dualities need to be removed to become enlightened.<span class="footnote">18</span> Undue and excessive ego cravings cause ignorance and evil in the world. Transmigration or possible rebirth in Buddhism is predicated on good or bad karma by sentient beings in their past lives. When a sentient being becomes enlightened, their suffering ceases.<span class="footnote">19</span> With enlightenment come bliss, joy, and happiness.</p>
            
            <div class="subsection-title">Early Bhutanese governmental promotion of happiness</div>
            
            <p>From a governmental and religious perspective, provisions for enlightenment and happiness began to be addressed in the early unwritten Constitution of Bhutan, as it unfolded over a number of iterations. The unwritten Constitution included the Nga Chudruma of 1619, the Tsa Yig Chenmo of 1629, the First Legal Code of 1652, and an updated Legal Code of 1729.<span class="footnote">20</span> Unwritten constitutions are non-constitutional writings that define a government's principal legitimacy, mission, and organizational form.<span class="footnote">21</span> The Nga Chudruma, with no direct provisions for happiness, was a testimony by the Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal on the legitimacy of ruling Bhutan as a Mahayana Buddhist kingdom. The verses of the Nga Chudruma state:</p>
            
            <div class="quote">
                I, who turn the wheel of the dual system; I, grant refuge to all;<br>
                I, am the holder of the precious teachings of Palden Drukpa; I, am the conqueror of all who pretends to be Drukpas;<br>
                I, am the one accomplished in poetry; I, am the source of moral aphorisms; I, the lord whose views are limitless; I, refute those who hold wrong views; I, the lord of the authority of debates;<br>
                I, am him before whom everyone trembles;<br>
                I, am the hero who conquers the host of evils;<br>
                I, am him whose powers cannot be obstructed by any sorcerer; I, the mighty lord with mastery over speech;<br>
                I, excel in all sciences;<br>
                I, am the emanation prophesized by illustrious beings; I, am the one who subdues imposters<span class="footnote">22</span>
            </div>
            
            <p>The Tsa Yig Chenmo continued after Bhutan's establishment in 1651, a principal religious code of mandatory monastic conduct. A sole provision associated with happiness in the Tsa Yig Chenmo cites the Buddha in the Sutras:</p>
            
            <div class="quote">
                A king, if he is fond of Dharma (the Buddhist religious codes and teachings), finds the path to happiness both in this and in the future lives. The subjects will act as the ruler acts, and therefore should the ruler strive to learn righteousness.<span class="footnote">23</span>
            </div>
            
            <p>The First and Second Legal Codes contained civil and criminal provisions.<span class="footnote">24</span> The only reference to happiness in the First Legal Code of 1652 is in the preamble:</p>
            
            <div class="quote">
                It is the nature of the Buddha and his heirs to engage in various skills in activities through which the benefit and happiness of the infinite world of sentient beings are obtained.<span class="footnote">25</span>
            </div>
            
            <p>There are numerous references to happiness in the Second Legal Code of 1729, as documented by Aris, who updated the first Legal Code.<span class="footnote">26</span> In the Introduction, it was inscribed:</p>
            
            <div class="quote">
                Following these words, in general, the happiness of all beings who are as limitless as the sky's extent depends on those very places where a Buddha's teachings have spread.
            </div>
            
            <p>Later in the Introduction of the Second Legal Code were several provisions related to seeking and finding enlightenment:</p>
            
            <div class="quote">
                The good religious observance of humans. Form the basis of the holy dharma.<br>
                The practice of the dharma together with its basis. Will gain one happiness.
            </div>
            
            <p>A further reference to happiness specifies:</p>
            
            <div class="quote">
                If there is no law, happiness will not come to beings. If beings do not have happiness, there is no point in the Hierarchs of the Brug-pa (leading school of Buddhism in Bhutan) upholding the doctrine of the dual system. Therefore, holding the precious doctrine in one's heart, it is necessary to enact legal observances like those of the Dharmaraja (head monk) Srong-btsans Gampo, which establish a justice devoid of bias or partiality.

            <p>The Second Legal Code continues by indicating:</p>
            
            <div class="quote">
                The happiness of beings depends on the doctrine. Moreover, the doctrine of being who upholds it. Thus it happened, and so for beings who uphold the doctrine, there is cause for desiring an establishment of happiness in doctrine and among beings by setting up whatever is fundamental to a dual system (Buddhist theocracy) under which all beings are looked upon as an only child.
            </div>
            
            <p>In the second part of the Second Legal Code, a critical section illustrates why rulers in a Bhutanese Buddhist theocracy should wisely lead so all citizens may become enlightened:</p>

                Now, as the chief actions befitting as Desrid Phyagmdzod, who is the illuminator of the doctrine of the joint system (of religious and state law) and master of the practice of legal observances, the Bhaavat (lord) has said in the sutras: If the king becomes enamored of religion, it is the path to happiness both in this and future lives. Subjects will also act as the king acts. Therefore he must learn how to live by religion.

            <p>Another passage in the Second Legal Code notes:</p>

                Following these words, since this southern range is itself the unequaled and glorious 'Brugpa Rinpoche's field of conversation.

            <div class="quote">
                In general, instituting laws is for the subjects' happiness in various districts. In particular, it is to uphold, guard, and diffuse the sangha (religious community), which [abides by] the Vinaya (complete teachings) rules of the Buddha and [forms] the basis of the doctrine.

            <p>These sections in the Tsa Yig Chhenmo and the First and Second Legal Codes from 1629 to 1729 provided for the Bhutanese government to promote conditions through wise rulers to allow citizens to become enlightened. This early version of happiness remained essentially unchanged from the seventeenth century.<span class="footnote">27</span> Seeking enlightenment and happiness remains, up to the present, a central feature of Mahayana Buddhism in Bhutan. How this traditional Mahayana Buddhism has adapted to powerful modern global secularization trends provides a primary basis for understanding and describing the promotion of modern happiness in Bhutan.<span class="footnote">28</span> Increasing secularization stemmed from the complex combination of modern science, contemporary technology, global capitalism, and materialism instead of or in disenchantment with traditional religious practices.<span class="footnote">29</span> The governmental effort to promote traditional and religious happiness in the presence of ongoing secularization formed the core of the Bhutanese program known from the 1970s to the present as Gross National Happiness, or GNH.</p>

            <div class="subsection-title">GNH as a strategic goal</div>
            
            <p>The early period of modern GNH in Bhutan as a strategic and broad governmental goal aligning Bhutan to GNH was launched as part of a significant political modification, developing soon after the advent of a new ruler and involving the first election to the office of Prime Minister. Bhutan's first elected Prime Minister, the Honorable Jigme Y. Thinley, recalled the process as follows:</p>
            
            <div class="quote">
                I was with His Majesty the (Fourth) King (King Jigme Singye Wangchuck) on the day of his coronation in 1974. He had ascended to the throne just two years earlier following a two-year period of mourning for the previous king, who passed away in 1972. Now I think that it was barely months thereafter that I heard him mention the term Gross National Happiness for the first time, so we are going back more than thirty years.<span class="footnote">30</span>
            </div>
            
            <p>The early strategic governmental purpose of GNH in Bhutan was later described in writing by King Jigme Singye Wangchuck in two 1980 <em>New York Times</em> news stories.<span class="footnote">31</span> King Wangchuck was quoted on April 29, 1980, <em>New York Times</em> as saying, "There is gross national product, but there is also GNH. He said while he is eager to improve the standard of living, he thinks there are other standards of contentment that should not be endangered by development."<span class="footnote">32</span> In a November 16, 1980, <em>New York Times</em> news story, King Wangchuck stated, "â€¦gross national happiness should not be sacrificed in the pursuit of a greater gross national product."<span class="footnote">33</span> A more detailed description of what GNH meant as a strategic goal appeared in a 1987 <em>Financial Times</em> of London news story when King Wangchuck declared:</p>
            
            <div class="quote">
                We are convinced that we must aim for contentment and happiness. Whether we take five years or 10 to raise the per capita income and increase prosperity is not going to guarantee that happiness, which includes political stability, social harmony, and the Bhutanese culture and way of life.<span class="footnote">34</span>
            </div>
            
            <p>This creation of GNH as a primary societal endeavor to promote happiness is due to the impetus to preserve ancient Buddhist culture and traditions amid increasing secularization. The rise in secularization in turn resulted from the increasing transformation of Bhutan into a modern capitalist consumer economy.<span class="footnote">35</span> The extent and nature of the rapid change in Bhutanese society has been described by Phuntsho as follows:</p>
            
            <div class="quote">
                One can safely claim that Bhutan has undergone much more change in the last 50 years than it had in the 500 years before that. Due to the successful programmes of modernisation and the widespread influence of the outside world through education, tourism, travel, and media, Bhutan is witnessing the adaptation, alteration, decline, and disappearance of traditional cultures at a scale and rate never seen in the past.<span class="footnote">36</span>
            </div>
            
            <p>A major 1998 speech in Seoul, South Korea, by His Excellency Lyonpo Jigmi Y. Thinley, Chair of the Council of Ministers, Royal Government of Bhutan, to the Millennium Meeting for Asia and the Pacific provided a further pronouncement of Bhutan's broad strategic goals and support of GNH.<span class="footnote">37</span> In that speech, Lyonpo Thinley stated that GNH was in a "paradoxical situation" in which</p>
            
            <div class="quote">
                â€¦ We do not need scientific proofs to assess happiness meaningfully. We can, and in my opinion, we must raise policy and ethical questions about happiness. It is a universal proposition and value. It is a goal all humanity shares in common.<span class="footnote">38</span>
            </div>
            
            <p>Lyonpo Thinley then stated that impacting happiness in the world as a policy inevitably contends with the leading implications of the modern age â€“ including information technology, shrinkage of cultural diversity, scientific methods undermining traditional spiritual beliefs, overall secularization, rapid automation, loneliness, capitalism, and new arrangements in global and regional governance.<span class="footnote">39</span></p>
            
            <p>According to Lyonpo Thinley, early GNH was a broad conceptual approach to mitigate modernization. That occurred by balancing materialism with traditional Mahayana Buddhist traditions and values. That was to be accomplished through four complementary and equally emphasized strategic goals, also known as the four pillars. The four pillars included economic self-reliance, environmental preservation, cultural promotion, and good governance.<span class="footnote">40</span></p>
            
            <p>Initially, the pillar of cultural promotion within GNH centered on promoting enlightenment. As Lyonpo Thinley explained:</p>
            
            <div class="quote">
                Within Bhutanese culture, inner spiritual (Buddhist) development is as prominent a focus as external material development. That follows from an original meaning of development in the Bhutanese context in which development meant enlightenment of the individual. I hasten to add that enlightenment is not solely an object of religious activity. Enlightenment is blossoming of happiness. It is made more probable by consciously creating a harmonious psychological, social, and economic environment.<span class="footnote">41</span>
            </div>
            
            <p>The environmental preservation pillar was defined as lessening damage to the natural ecosystem. That was because humans are sentient beings that co-exist with other sentient life forms on the planet.<span class="footnote">42</span> The pillar of economic self-reliance focused on countering the rich's overreliance on money and wealth at the expense of the poor. Good governance at that time was oriented toward decentralizing political and administrative power within Bhutan's hereditary monarchy.<span class="footnote">43</span></p>
            
            <p>A 2005 keynote address to the <em>Second International Conference on Gross National Happiness</em> by then Bhutanese Minister of Home and Cultural Affairs, Minister Jigme Y. Thinley, provided an updated Bhutanese government description of the broad strategic meaning of GNH.<span class="footnote">44</span> GNH included addressing the more holistic concerns of Mahayana Buddhism, more conducive societal conditions toward becoming enlightened and happy, and the government's role in advancing happiness. The updated four pillars of GNH now include sustainable and equitable socio-economic development, conservation of the environment, preservation and promotion of culture, and good governance.<span class="footnote">45</span> Sustainable and equitable socio-economic development focused on economic activity, including the role of non-economic social activities like free time and family life. It also included income redistribution. Conservation of the environment included happiness as related to preserving and maintaining natural ecosystems. Preserving culture included maintaining traditional values with human rights and freedom of religion. Finally, good governance in Bhutan pertained to drafting a new constitution providing democratic rights and responsibilities.<span class="footnote">46</span></p>
            
            <div class="subsection-title">Modern GNH and methodological expediency</div>
            
            <p>In 2008, Bhutan, with the adoption of its first written Constitution, became a form of democracy known as a constitutional or democratic monarchy.<span class="footnote">47</span> The new Constitution provided and required government implementation of GNH. As Article 9 of the Constitution states, "The State shall strive to promote those conditions that will enable the pursuit of Gross National Happiness."<span class="footnote">48</span></p>
