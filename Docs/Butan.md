THE TRANSITION FROM
EARLY TO MODERN
HAPPINESS IN BHUTAN
Michael S. Givel
The Kingdom of Bhutan is located in the mountainous Himalayan region northeast of
modern India and south of the modern Autonomous Region of Tibet. Since its inception
in 1651, Bhutan has engaged in a unique governmental effort to promote happiness for its
citizens. The original approach from 1651 to the 1970s centered on Mahayana Buddhist
traditions of seeking enlightenment leading to bliss and happiness.
At the same time, the nature and meaning of happiness in Bhutan have evolved con‑
siderably from the seventeenth century to the present. Since the 1970s, a modern pe‑
riod known as Gross National Happiness (GNH) has taken shape, partly grounded in
Mahayana Buddhist traditions. As influential modern trends such as world trade that
transcends borders, world capitalism, and urbanization have progressed, this has pre‑
cipitated a deliberate effort in Bhutan through GNH to preserve ancient Buddhist happi‑
ness practices. This attempt to preserve traditional culture has also been balanced with
contemporary happiness issues, like a suitable standard of living. As a result, GNH has
been a guiding framework in Bhutan to further a new form of happiness in the modern
era, while at the same time Bhutan has worked for greater international recognition of
its approach.
With this are two critical questions regarding the historical transformation of happi‑
ness in Bhutan. First, what is traditional happiness’ direct connection to current happi‑
ness efforts in Bhutan? Furthermore, how has modern happiness in Bhutan influenced
efforts for happiness worldwide? This chapter addresses these two questions using a
qualitative chronological, historical, and content analysis approach. That will be ac‑
complished by utilizing all pertinent peer‑reviewed literature and research related to the
historical evolution of classic happiness to modern happiness in Bhutan. Key milestones
in relevant cultural and governmental development and changes involved in the transi‑
tion from classic to modern Bhutanese happiness are explored causally and chronologi‑
cally. Analysis also includes an overview of current happiness promotion from Bhutan
to the world.The transition from early to modern happiness in Bhutan

Traditional happiness in Bhutan
Ancient happiness in Bhutan began to be defined in the seventeenth century, with increas‑
ing detail in a series of official documents. In 1594, Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal, the
future founder of Bhutan, was born into the Gya clan in Tibet.1 In 1606, the Shabdrung
was anointed the eighteenth hereditary Prince‑Abbot of the Brugpa Monastery at Ralung
in Tibet.2 During this period, the Shabdrung was ranked the fifth most powerful official in
the Tibetan religious and political order. However, he was exiled in 1616 due to a power
struggle with an opposing Abbot – gTsang‑pa. Shabdrung later fled south of Tibet to what
now is modern Bhutan. Shabdrung’s arrival in 1616 began the traditional interest in defin‑
ing happiness in Bhutan.
From the beginning of the nation of Bhutan in 1651 to the present, Mahayana Buddhism
has been intricately intertwined with Bhutan’s culture and politics.3 Buddhists far and wide
recognize that suffering exists as part of the human condition. The state of enlightenment,
defined as “extinguishing desire,” involves becoming deeply aware of (but not one with)
the reality of the vast, ever‑changing, and impermanent cosmos. With this comes bliss and
happiness, which is a principal goal of Buddhism. Traditional happiness in Bhutan emerged
through a Buddhist dual system of government or theocracy, also known as Chhoe‑sid‑nyi.
It was promoted through government and religious practices, edicts, and laws creating the
condition for individuals if they chose to seek enlightenment.
The path to enlightenment and happiness
How can individuals attain enlightenment? That largely occurs through comprehension of
the Four Noble Truths. The First Noble Truth is the truth that suffering exists.4 The Second
Noble Truth is understanding that suffering occurs through undue ego cravings for material
things, power over others, sensuality, and failing to realize the path to enlightenment.5 The
Third Noble Truth is knowing there is a path to cease suffering. That path is the Fourth
Noble Truth, known as the Noble Eightfold Path. The Noble Eightfold Path provides direc‑
tion on becoming enlightened, ending suffering, and being blissful and happy.6 The Noble
Eightfold Path is divided into three parts. Sila includes good moral deeds and refraining
from inappropriate actions of body and speech. Samadhi emphasizes meditation practices
to achieve enlightenment. Prajña offers understanding and knowledge to being enlightened.
Within Sila are Right Speech, Right Action, and Right Livelihood.7 Right Speech is ab‑
staining from speech such as slander and gossip that harms others. Instead, it is important
to participate in speech that aids others.8 Right Action is not causing harm (including crimi‑
nal acts) to all sentient beings.9 Right Livelihood includes working in occupations that do
not cause harm, pain, or injustice to sentient beings.10 For instance, manufacturing, selling,
and promoting weapons that unduly harm others are counter to Right Livelihood.
In Samadhi are three additional parts of the Noble Eightfold Path Right Effort, Right
Mindfulness, and Right Concentration. Right effort includes continuing meditation prac‑
tices to counter undesirable mental states and to become enlightened.11 Right Mindfulness
concentrates on what is happening in the present, which is accomplished through medita‑
tion practices.12 That permits one to have a profound awareness of the nature of the universe
and is essential to becoming enlightened. Right Concentration is the practice of focusing a
mind sharply and lucidly in order to become more aware of the nature of cosmic reality.Michael S. Givel

Prajña contains the final two parts of the Noble Eightfold Path, including Right Under‑
standing and Right Thought. Right Understanding includes a deep grasp of the fact that
the Four Noble Truths can counter suffering and lead to happiness. Right Thought includes
cultivating a mental awareness that counters unwholesome ego cravings.13 When an indi‑
vidual completely practices and integrates the eight parts of the Noble Eightfold Path into
their life, they are on the path to being enlightened and happy.
A critical practice in obtaining bliss and happiness through enlightenment is karma or
the law of cause and effect.14 When an individual engages in ongoing good actions that
counter unwarranted ego craving, including compassionate acts that do not harm any sen‑
tient being, these result in Vipaka or a ripening of good karmic deeds. When a person is
reborn (though there is no guarantee of being reborn as is valid with reincarnation), good
karmic deeds in a past life can result in a life of greater happiness, joy, and bliss.
Negative karma, or harmful deeds, in a lifetime due to ignorance of being enlightened,
anger and hate, and undue ego craving means humans have stumbled and are destined to
persist on an ever‑turning Wheel of Life.15 Those who continue on the Wheel of Life are
stuck and suffer in their current worldly existence. In a rebirth, depending on the accrual
of good or bad karma in a past life, an individual can be reborn in six realms of existence.
The following definitions for these six realms should not be taken literally. Instead,
they are metaphorical depictions of human existence. In the three higher realms are the
gods, meaning experiencing a life full of vast pleasure and happiness. Next is the realm of
demi‑gods in which pleasure and happiness are abundant. However, demi‑gods can squab‑
ble and fight among themselves. Finally, there is the human realm in which there is suffer‑
ing, including sickness, old age, hunger, and poverty.
In the lower realm, due to bad karma, one can be reborn as an animal whose existence is
principally instinctual and out of control. Further down are hungry ghosts where one is in
a state of incessant seeking of undue ego cravings and desires. At the bottom of the lower
realm is hell, with powerful suffering and deprivation. Only by becoming enlightened can
an individual leave the Wheel of Life.
Overview of Mahayana Buddhist worldview
The core beliefs of Mahayana Buddhism include the impermanent, unified, and non‑dual
cosmic universe, mitigating undue ego craving, karma, transmigration or rebirth, and be‑
coming enlightened. Throughout the cosmic universe, impermanence is where all matter
and energy are created, persists, and declines.16 Becoming more conscious of this reality is
significant in becoming enlightened.17 The non‑duality of reality means that all in the uni‑
fied universe are related to each other. In the end, there are no binary opposites. Moreover,
any dualities, like armed conflicts, are based on self‑illusions. Beliefs in dualities need to be
removed to become enlightened.18 Undue and excessive ego cravings cause ignorance and
evil in the world. Transmigration or possible rebirth in Buddhism is predicated on good or
bad karma by sentient beings in their past lives. When a sentient being becomes enlight‑
ened, their suffering ceases.19 With enlightenment come bliss, joy, and happiness.
Early Bhutanese governmental promotion of happiness
From a governmental and religious perspective, provisions for enlightenment and happiness
began to be addressed in the early unwritten Constitution of Bhutan, as it unfolded overThe transition from early to modern happiness in Bhutan
57
a number of iterations. The unwritten Constitution included the Nga Chudruma of 1619,
the Tsa Yig Chenmo of 1629, the First Legal Code of 1652, and an updated Legal Code of
1729.20 Unwritten constitutions are non‑constitutional writings that define a government’s
principal legitimacy, mission, and organizational form.21 The Nga Chudruma, with no di‑
rect provisions for happiness, was a testimony by the Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal on
the legitimacy of ruling Bhutan as a Mahayana Buddhist kingdom. The verses of the Nga
Chudruma state:
I, who turn the wheel of the dual system;
I, grant refuge to all;
I, am the holder of the precious teachings of Palden Drukpa;
I, am the conqueror of all who pretends to be Drukpas;
I, am the one accomplished in poetry;
I, am the source of moral aphorisms;
I, the lord whose views are limitless;
I, refute those who hold wrong views;
I, the lord of the authority of debates;
I, am him before whom everyone trembles;
I, am the hero who conquers the host of evils;
I, am him whose powers cannot be obstructed by any sorcerer;
I, the mighty lord with mastery over speech;
I, excel in all sciences;
I, am the emanation prophesized by illustrious beings;
I, am the one who subdues imposters 22
The Tsa Yig Chenmo continued after Bhutan’s establishment in 1651, a principal religious
code of mandatory monastic conduct. A sole provision associated with happiness in the Tsa
Yig Chenmo cites the Buddha in the Sutras:
A king, if he is fond of Dharma (the Buddhist religious codes and teachings), finds the
path to happiness both in this and in the future lives. The subjects will act as the ruler
acts, and therefore should the ruler strive to learn righteousness.23
The First and Second Legal Codes contained civil and criminal provisions.24 The only refer‑
ence to happiness in the First Legal Code of 1652 is in the preamble:
It is the nature of the Buddha and his heirs to engage in various skills in activities
through which the benefit and happiness of the infinite world of sentient beings are
obtained.25
There are numerous references to happiness in the Second Legal Code of 1729, as docu‑
mented by Aris, who updated the first Legal Code.26
In the Introduction, it was inscribed:
Following these words, in general, the happiness of all beings who are as limitless
as the sky’s extent depends on those very places where a Buddha’s teachings have
spread.Michael S. Givel
58
Later in the Introduction of the Second Legal Code were several provisions related to seek‑
ing and finding enlightenment:
The good religious observance of humans.
Form the basis of the holy dharma.
The practice of the dharma together with its basis.
Will gain one happiness.
A further reference to happiness specifies:
If there is no law, happiness will not come to beings. If beings do not have happi‑
ness, there is no point in the Hierarchs of the Brug‑pa (leading school of Buddhism in
Bhutan) upholding the doctrine of the dual system. Therefore, holding the precious
doctrine in one’s heart, it is necessary to enact legal observances like those of the
Dharmaraja (head monk) Srong‑btsans Gampo, which establish a justice devoid of
bias or partiality.
The Second Legal Code continues by indicating:
The happiness of beings depends on the doctrine. Moreover, the doctrine of being
who upholds it. Thus it happened, and so for beings who uphold the doctrine, there is
cause for desiring an establishment of happiness in doctrine and among beings by set‑
ting up whatever is fundamental to a dual system (Buddhist theocracy) under which
all beings are looked upon as an only child.
In the second part of the Second Legal Code, a critical section illustrates why rulers in a
Bhutanese Buddhist theocracy should wisely lead so all citizens may become enlightened:
Now, as the chief actions befitting as Desrid Phyagmdzod, who is the illuminator of
the doctrine of the joint system (of religious and state law) and master of the practice
of legal observances, the Bhaavat (lord) has said in the sutras: If the king becomes
enamored of religion, it is the path to happiness both in this and future lives. Subjects
will also act as the king acts. Therefore he must learn how to live by religion.
Another passage in the Second Legal Code notes:
Following these words, since this southern range is itself the unequaled and glorious
`Brugpa Rinpoche’s field of conversation. There is a definite need/for no inferior de‑
signs to hinder the happiness of beings and the doctrine by honoring on high the lotus
feet of Mighty Ngag‑gi d‑Bangpo, Jina’s ruler.
Moreover:
In general, instituting laws is for the subjects’ happiness in various districts. In
particular, it is to uphold, guard, and diffuse the sangha (religious community), which
[abides by] the Vinaya (complete teachings) rules of the Buddha and [forms] the basis
of the doctrine.The transition from early to modern happiness in Bhutan
59
A subsequent reference to happiness in the Second Legal Code indicates:
When the Vinaya rule declines, the land is filled with oath‑breakers.
The causes of happiness of beings diminish.
The last passage referencing happiness in the Second Legal Code states:
Which is the goal of temporal circumstances, the sure result of beneficial happiness.
These sections in the Tsa Yig Chhenmo and the First and Second Legal Codes from 1629
to 1729 provided for the Bhutanese government to promote conditions through wise rul‑
ers to allow citizens to become enlightened. This early version of happiness remained es‑
sentially unchanged from the seventeenth century.27 Seeking enlightenment and happiness
remains, up to the present, a central feature of Mahayana Buddhism in Bhutan. How this
traditional Mahayana Buddhism has adapted to powerful modern global secularization
trends provides a primary basis for understanding and describing the promotion of modern
happiness in Bhutan.28 Increasing secularization stemmed from the complex combination
of modern science, contemporary technology, global capitalism, and materialism instead of
or in disenchantment with traditional religious practices.29 The governmental effort to pro‑
mote traditional and religious happiness in the presence of ongoing secularization formed
the core of the Bhutanese program known from the 1970s to the present as Gross National
Happiness, or GNH.
Modern happiness in Bhutan
GNH as a strategic goal
The early period of modern GNH in Bhutan as a strategic and broad governmental goal
aligning Bhutan to GNH was launched as part of a significant political modification, de‑
veloping soon after the advent of a new ruler and involving the first election to the office
of Prime Minister. Bhutan’s first elected Prime Minister, the Honorable Jigme Y. Thinley,
recalled the process as follows:
I was with His Majesty the (Fourth) King (King Jigme Singye Wangchuck) on the
day of his coronation in 1974. He had ascended to the throne just two years earlier
following a two‑year period of mourning for the previous king, who passed away in
1972. Now I think that it was barely months thereafter that I heard him mention the
term Gross National Happiness for the first time, so we are going back more than
thirty years.30
The early strategic governmental purpose of GNH in Bhutan was later described in writ‑
ing by King Jigme Singye Wangchuck in two 1980 New York Times news stories.31 King
Wangchuck was quoted on April 29, 1980, New York Times as saying, “There is gross
national product, but there is also GNH. He said while he is eager to improve the standard
of living, he thinks there are other standards of contentment that should not be endangeredMichael S. Givel
60
by development.”32 In a November 16, 1980, New York Times news story, King Wang‑
chuck stated, “…gross national happiness should not be sacrificed in the pursuit of a
greater gross national product.”33 A more detailed description of what GNH meant as a
strategic goal appeared in a 1987 Financial Times of London news story when King Wang‑
chuck declared:
We are convinced that we must aim for contentment and happiness. Whether we take
five years or 10 to raise the per capita income and increase prosperity is not going to
guarantee that happiness, which includes political stability, social harmony, and the
Bhutanese culture and way of life.34
This creation of GNH as a primary societal endeavor to promote happiness is due to the
impetus to preserve ancient Buddhist culture and traditions amid increasing secularization.
The rise in secularization in turn resulted from the increasing transformation of Bhutan
into a modern capitalist consumer economy.35 The extent and nature of the rapid change in
Bhutanese society has been described by Phuntsho as follows:
One can safely claim that Bhutan has undergone much more change in the last 50
years than it had in the 500 years before that. Due to the successful programmes of
modernisation and the widespread influence of the outside world through education,
tourism, travel, and media, Bhutan is witnessing the adaptation, alteration, decline,
and disappearance of traditional cultures at a scale and rate never seen in the past.36
A major 1998 speech in Seoul, South Korea, by His Excellency Lyonpo Jigmi Y. Thinley,
Chair of the Council of Ministers, Royal Government of Bhutan, to the Millennium Meet‑
ing for Asia and the Pacific provided a further pronouncement of Bhutan’s broad strategic
goals and support of GNH.37 In that speech, Lyonpo Thinley stated that GNH was in a
“paradoxical situation” in which
… We do not need scientific proofs to assess happiness meaningfully. We can, and in
my opinion, we must raise policy and ethical questions about happiness. It is a univer‑
sal proposition and value. It is a goal all humanity shares in common.38
Lyonpo Thinley then stated that impacting happiness in the world as a policy inevitably
contends with the leading implications of the modern age – including information technol‑
ogy, shrinkage of cultural diversity, scientific methods undermining traditional spiritual
beliefs, overall secularization, rapid automation, loneliness, capitalism, and new arrange‑
ments in global and regional governance.39
According to Lyonpo Thinley, early GNH was a broad conceptual approach to mitigate
modernization. That occurred by balancing materialism with traditional Mahayana Bud‑
dhist traditions and values. That was to be accomplished through four complementary
and equally emphasized strategic goals, also known as the four pillars. The four pillars
included economic self‑reliance, environmental preservation, cultural promotion, and good
governance.40The transition from early to modern happiness in Bhutan
61
Initially, the pillar of cultural promotion within GNH centered on promoting enlighten‑
ment. As Lyonpo Thinley explained:
Within Bhutanese culture, inner spiritual (Buddhist) development is as prominent a
focus as external material development. That follows from an original meaning of
development in the Bhutanese context in which development meant enlightenment of
the individual. I hasten to add that enlightenment is not solely an object of religious
activity. Enlightenment is blossoming of happiness. It is made more probable by con‑
sciously creating a harmonious psychological, social, and economic environment.41
The environmental preservation pillar was defined as lessening damage to the natural eco‑
system. That was because humans are sentient beings that co‑exist with other sentient life
forms on the planet.42 The pillar of economic self‑reliance focused on countering the rich’s
overreliance on money and wealth at the expense of the poor. Good governance at that
time was oriented toward decentralizing political and administrative power within Bhutan’s
hereditary monarchy.43
A 2005 keynote address to the Second International Conference on Gross National
Happiness by then Bhutanese Minister of Home and Cultural Affairs, Minister Jigme Y.
Thinley, provided an updated Bhutanese government description of the broad strategic
meaning of GNH.44 GNH included addressing the more holistic concerns of Mahayana
Buddhism, more conducive societal conditions toward becoming enlightened and happy,
and the government’s role in advancing happiness. The updated four pillars of GNH
now include sustainable and equitable socio‑economic development, conservation of the
environment, preservation and promotion of culture, and good governance.45 Sustain‑
able and equitable socio‑economic development focused on economic activity, including
the role of non‑economic social activities like free time and family life. It also included
income redistribution. Conservation of the environment included happiness as related
to preserving and maintaining natural ecosystems. Preserving culture included maintain‑
ing traditional values with human rights and freedom of religion. Finally, good govern‑
ance in Bhutan pertained to drafting a new constitution providing democratic rights and
responsibilities.46
Modern GNH and methodological expediency
In 2008, Bhutan, with the adoption of its first written Constitution, became a form of
democracy known as a constitutional or democratic monarchy.47 The new Constitution
provided and required government implementation of GNH. As Article 9 of the Constitu‑
tion states, “The State shall strive to promote those conditions that will enable the pursuit
of Gross National Happiness.”48
Also, in 2008, the Centre for Bhutan Studies developed the Gross National Happiness
Index (GNHI) to quantify, operationalize, and assess government values and programs
related to GNH.49 On page 16 of the Tenth Five Year Plan of Bhutan (2008–2013), also
published in 2008, was a new and more thorough explanation of the quantitative nature
of GNH assessment and implementation.50 The strategic and original four pillars of GNHMichael S. Givel
62
were to be expanded into nine quantifiable domains measuring specific complex national
demographic sentiments of happiness.
Furthermore, the new effort included assessment of central government agency perfor‑
mance and goals in implementing GNH. As a result, the GNH Commission has overseen
national planning, national evaluations, and government agency implementation of GNH
throughout the Bhutanese executive branch.51 As written in the 2015 report, Well‑being,
Happiness, and Public Policy published by The Centre for Bhutan & GNH Studies in
Thimphu:
These nine domains of GNH were developed by Dasho Karma Ura (Director of the
Centre for GNH Studies) to specify the four pillars of GNH articulated in Bhutan’s
10th plan. They were used in the initial pilot of the GNH index, fielded in 2006, in
the first national pilot GNH Index in 2008, and the 2010 GNH Index.52
The three domains of standard of living, health, and education were subdivided under the
heading of equitable socio‑economic development. The original pillar of good governance
remained its own domain. Sectioned from the original pillar of preservation and culture were
the four domains of cultural vitality and diversity, psychological well‑being, time use and bal‑
ance, and community vitality. The original pillar of ecosystem vitality remained as a domain.53
Furthermore, an explanation of the basis of the values for the new nine domains included:
Who says that the domains are of value? Anyone can. We do not establish the nine
domains based on any single philosophy, religion, or theory of human good. Rather,
their value rests, epistemologically, on practical reason, which means it can be cor‑
roborated by anyone who is observant of their own and other’s experiences of fulfill‑
ment through direct experience, literature, film, or conversation, and does not have a
prior ideological or theoretical framework but is open to experience.54
Essentially, each domain embodies a vital part of Bhutanese national well‑being and happi‑
ness. In a more holistic manner, GNH was to be achieved in all domains, with no domain
superior to any others.
In 2005, the Bhutanese government moved forward toward operationalizing the nine
domains of GNH with evidence‑based statistical data.55 A national psychometric random
sample was subsequently utilized to assess citizen perceptions of GNH. The GNHI survey
used a multifactor statistical approach known as the Foster‑Alkire statistical method of
sufficiency.56
The GNHI survey included questions related to the nine domains, and this was later
further subdivided into 33 weighted indicators.57 For example, the health domain had four
weighted indicators: self‑reported health at 10 percent, healthy days at 30 percent, disabil‑
ity at 30 percent, and mental health at 30 percent.58 Happiness in GNH is calculated by
calculating the percentage of happy people, and then calculating the intensity or sufficiency
of happiness by survey respondents in six or more of the nine domains.59 Sufficiency of
happiness is determined by the average number of domains in which not‑yet‑happy people
are happy. This has in turn been divided into those who indicate they are deeply happy in
77 percent to 100 percent of the domains; extensively happy in 66 percent to 76 percent of
the domains; narrowly happy in 50 percent to 65 percent of domains; and unhappy in 49
percent or fewer of the domains.60The transition from early to modern happiness in Bhutan
63
While the GNHI is intended as an authoritative approach to assessing happiness trends
in Bhutan, there have also been recommendations for another authoritative measurement
approach to assess happiness based on a comprehensive dashboard set of indicators.61 The
dashboard approach includes utilizing several critical indicators like the GNHI with other
surveys – for instance, civil liberties and political rights conclusions from the annual Free‑
dom House survey;62 or annual survey results from the United Nations Sustainable Devel‑
opment Goals that focus on countering poverty and climate change.63 The key conclusions
of all of these surveys are then compared side‑by‑side to provide a nuanced examination
and description of current trends in happiness in a society like Bhutan.64
From the official Bhutanese standpoint, however, the use of modern statistical assess‑
ments to measure demographic perceptions of happiness and governmental implementa‑
tion of GNH continues to refer back to the earlier Bhutanese Mahayana Buddhist values
and traditions. In the modern era and particularly since 2008, this has been balanced with
constitutional requirements for freedom of religion.65 Particularly through the emphasis on
the domain of cultural vitality and diversity, but also as part of some other domains, the
goal has consistently involved preserving and promoting early Bhutanese and Mahayana
Buddhist traditions and culture. This is clear in the historical context of GNH, with the
original public declarations and government goals. By 2008 and thereafter, the whole GNH
campaign – complete with unusually elaborate assessment mechanisms – became a prime
governmental public policy approach in addressing modernization, globalization and capi‑
talism, and secularization, balancing these modern trends with Bhutan’s ancient Mahayana
Buddhist traditions and culture toward the goal of becoming enlightened and happy.66
GNH since 2008
Since 2008, a rich scholarly literature on GNH has emerged in two main conceptual areas.
That includes GNH as a form of Buddhist modernism and GNH as a unique development
approach. Two other vital sub‑areas have focused on how the Bhutanese government has
implemented GNH, from a governmental public policymaking perspective, and how the
program represents an exercise in deliberative democracy.
GNH and Buddhism in the modern age
In our contemporary age of modernization, Buddhist modernism, including GNH and the
nine domains, derives from traditional Buddhist values and traditions. This has occurred
as these traditional values encounter and adapt to significant modern secularization and
economic changes in societies,67 including the movement from a traditional rural base to an
increasingly urban society.68 In Bhutan as elsewhere, a primary catalyst for a more modern
and secular society has been world capitalist transactions in markets, trade, and invest‑
ments in which goods and services flow between nations.69 From a historical context, the
resultant transition from traditional happiness to GNH represents a new period in the
nature of happiness in Bhutan.
GNH as a more holistic development approach
GNH as a form of Buddhist modernism is also directly connected to GNH as a devel‑
opment approach.70 GNH, which balances modern materialism and secularization withMichael S. Givel
64
traditional Mahayana Buddhist practices and traditions, represents a more holistic and
multi‑dimensional development approach.71 Thus, economic growth and development are
interlinked with and dependent on various factors, including social areas like education, en‑
vironmental protection, and political areas like anti‑corruption and democratic practices.72
Concerning equitable socio‑economic development, one area of academic scrutiny has
been whether GNH involves a form of “degrowth” to counter unsustainable economic
development.73 Verma has argued that “sustainable degrowth” and GNH both represent
an effort to enhance human well‑being and ecological sustainability. In particular, Verma
argues that unbridled economic growth is often conceptualized and advanced as only for‑
warding free market neo‑liberal policies. This neo‑liberal approach disregards other impor‑
tant development policies – including environmental protection, cultural preservation of
traditional Tibetan Buddhist culture and values (in Bhutan), and good governance.
On the other hand, Masaki argues that expanding economic growth is compatible with
GNH and does not impede greater happiness.74 From a conceptual perspective, all nine
domains that include economic growth can provide for and are characteristic of modern
GNH as a development approach.75
GNH as public policy
In addition to assessing national sentiments related to happiness, another fundamental pur‑
pose of the nine domains and 33 indicators of GNH is the quantification and measurement
of government agencies’ implementation of GNH governmental policies and programs.76
Public policy is defined as what government institutions, including executive, legislative,
and judicial branches of government, do or do not do. For instance, what Bhutanese legis‑
lative parliamentary laws promote GNH, and for what purposes? Or what written judicial
decisions have Bhutanese higher courts rendered to interpret the legality and purpose of
GNH? Or what have public agencies in the executive branch done to carry out and further
the intent of GNH?
Bhutanese legislative policymaking from 2008 to 2019 included ratification of happiness
provisions in the 2008 Bhutanese written Constitution and legislation in five of nine GNH
domains.77 The 2008 constitutional provision requires that Bhutan implement GNH as an
all‑encompassing national policy and priority. The Acts in which happiness was codified
were in the areas of health, economic development, cultural resiliency, good governance,
and ecological resiliency.78 One other Act codified happiness in the new area of disaster
management. There were no written court decisions related to happiness from 2008 to
2019.79 As noted earlier in this chapter, in the executive branch, the GNH Commission has
overseen the national implementation of GNH in all government agencies.80 From 2008 to
2019, and as is required in the 2008 Constitution, Bhutan’s executive, legislative, and judi‑
cial governmental actions have provided a solid foundation for sponsoring and continuing
GNH with no major changes.
GNH as deliberative democracy
Recent scholarship has maintained that Bhutan is or ought to be practicing deliberative
democracy.81 Deliberative democracy is defined as an effective method of government en‑
actment of laws, regulations, and programs. At the same time, based on policy expertThe transition from early to modern happiness in Bhutan
65
evaluations and decision‑making, it does not bypass democratic decision‑making by all,
including non‑policy experts.82 Within a deliberative democracy system, networked private
and public policy actors and entrepreneurs advance their policy agendas. Thus, deliberative
democracy promotes open group and individual involvement in governmental policymak‑
ing. This involvement can be based on cooperation or contestation.
The deliberative policymaking perspective is congruent with the classic pluralistic theo‑
retical political perspective.83 In classic pluralism, it is said that various interest groups can
all equally engage in political bargaining among themselves and have equal access and
abilities to influence legislation and policy in a political process. That is mainly based on
incremental or small political decisions through group interaction, with a variety of policies
based on decision‑making or on maintaining the status quo.84 Also, in classic pluralism, the
relationship between rulers and the ruled is reciprocal; there are multiple centers of power,
and power is decentralized and non‑cumulative, with no one group dominating.85 It is
still too early to determine whether the new Bhutanese democracy is based on deliberative
democracy and classic pluralism or on some other theoretical model of democracy – for
instance, elite pluralism and democracy in which more powerful interests, groups, individu‑
als, and classes tend to dominate over others in the political process.86 Ongoing scholarly
research will begin to answer this vital question.
GNH from a global perspective
A crucial aspect of the GNH movement in Bhutan has been the effort to promote greater
international attention. A crucial step to advance GNH in international affairs occurred on
July 19, 2011, which was when the United Nations General Assembly approved Resolution
65/309, Happiness: Towards a Holistic Definition of Development. The Resolution was
sponsored by Bhutan and passed without a dissenting vote. The Resolution recommended
that member nations begin national domestic processes and policies to incorporate the
primary goal of well‑being and happiness.87 The Resolution also stated that “the pursuit
of happiness is a fundamental human goal,” as reflected in the goals and objectives of the
United Nations Millennium Development Goals.88 This Resolution was non‑binding on
member states. Beginning in 2012, the United Nations has also issued an annual World
Happiness Report that reviews the current state of world happiness in member nations, as
well as current policy and societal issues that impact happiness around the planet.89
Conclusion
Traditional happiness in early Bhutan rested on the main societal mission of wise leaders
promoting the conditions for citizens to seek and become enlightened and happy. Since the
mid‑twentieth century, Bhutanese society has been in a rapid transition.90 Ancient Buddhist
beliefs are now contending with and adapting to modernization, secularization, and glo‑
balization.91 A detailed overview of the features of modern GNH since 2008 has been well
documented and researched. A synopsis includes the following.
• First and foremost, GNH is a form of Buddhist modernism. This chapter illustrates that
the historical context and evidence are overwhelmingly clear in this regard. The purpose
of GNH is to preserve Buddhist traditions to become enlightened in the face of powerfulMichael S. Givel

modern forces in the world, such as secularization, capitalism, and urbanization. But the
result has been an unusually early, focused and explicit governmental effort to define and
measure the components of happiness in the contemporary world.
• The period from the 1970s to 2008 emphasized the constituent features of GNH, based
on broad qualitative and documented governmental policy statements and goals. From
2008 to the present, the strategic goals of the original four pillars of GNH were ex‑
panded into nine quantifiable and equally emphasized domains.
• With the nine domains, Bhutan’s GNH approach is significantly more holistic than con‑
ventional measures of societal progress based on economic output and productivity,
such as GDP. GNH is more holistic because it incorporates multi‑dimensional social, cul‑
tural, and environmental considerations, advancing them as equal in importance GDP
and other strictly economic outcomes.
• Public policymaking in Bhutan to further GNH and happiness from 2008 to 2019 in the
form of executive branch actions, judicial decisions, and constitutional provisions and
legislative Acts has, so far, substantially implemented the original overarching provisions
and goals of the nine domains. There have been no significant or even minor societal
challenges in promoting GNH as required in the 2008 Bhutanese Constitution.
• Some scholars have also posited that the new GNH and democratic system since 2008
have provided an opportunity for deliberative democracy in Bhutan. That is congruent
with classic pluralist theory. Ongoing research is needed to investigate this further.
The meaning of modern happiness and GNH in Bhutan has been solidly grounded in gen‑
eral overarching concepts of traditional and modern happiness. Where Bhutan goes in the
future in advancing and indeed defining Buddhist modernism and happiness continues to be
an unfolding story. The same holds true for any international implications of the Bhutanese
approach.
