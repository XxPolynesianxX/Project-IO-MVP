**ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS**
1. When asked to create or modify a page, DO NOT ATTEMPT TO MANUALLY REBUILD INDEX.HTML
2. Always sequentially think through your response before proceeding. If you are unsure of anything or there are multiple options, ask me clarification questions
3. Design your content to be optimised for a mobile phone form factor e.g. vertical display, scrolling etc2
4. When using the 'file system' MCP, always attempt to EDIT THE FILE. Only use WRITE FILE command if you cannot EDIT.


**DEFINITIONS**
1. File Pattern - refers to the sequential ordering of pages (e.g. page1, page2, page3, etc) contained within C:\DEV\Project IO MVP\content

**SPECIFIC COMMANDS**
Whenever I ask you to **[create page]**, this is what I want you to do:
1. Create a new page in the C:\DEV\Project IO MVP\content that follows the sequential order of the other pages in the directory
2. In this new page I want you to apply the exact same style and format as contained in page1, except I want you to use a different chinese characters, ideally in the form of a common '成语' and a quote / phrase that best captures the content. Try to be creative, poetic and nuanced in your answer, as if you were a chinese writer with both eastern and western influences
3. after that, update the background transitions css located in C:\DEV\Project IO MVP\css\background-transitions.css with a relevant image. Please find a relevant image online by doing the following:
3.1 Reading the new page's content (Chinese character + quote)
3.2 Generate relevant search terms based on the meaning
3.3 Find appropriate images from free sources
3.4 check that the URL works, if it doesnt, repeat step 3
3.5 Update the background-transitions.CSS file with the new image url
