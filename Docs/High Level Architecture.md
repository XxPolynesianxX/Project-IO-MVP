High-Level Architecture
1. Core Structure

Create a main navigation system that loads content dynamically
Use either a Single Page Application (SPA) approach or multiple interconnected HTML pages
Implement smooth scrolling transitions between content sections

2. Content Organization

Create numbered page components (page1.html, page2.html, etc.)
Each page should contain enough content to fill the viewport
Include engaging content (text, images, videos, interactive elements)

3. Navigation System

Add "Next" and "Previous" buttons/links
Implement infinite scroll detection when user reaches bottom of page
Create a progress indicator showing current position in the sequence

4. Technical Implementation Options
Option A: Multi-Page Approach

Separate HTML files for each page
Use JavaScript to preload next page content
Implement smooth page transitions with CSS animations

Option B: Single Page App

One HTML file with multiple content sections
JavaScript to show/hide sections dynamically
Smooth scrolling between sections

5. Essential Features

Responsive design for mobile doom-scrolling
Fast loading times with lazy loading for images/videos
Keyboard navigation (arrow keys, spacebar)
URL routing to allow direct linking to specific pages

6. File Structure
Project IO MVP/
├── index.html (main entry point)
├── css/
│   └── styles.css
├── js/
│   └── script.js
├── pages/
│   ├── page1.html
│   ├── page2.html
│   └── ...
└── assets/
    ├── images/
    └── media/
7. Key JavaScript Functions Needed

Page navigation controller
Smooth scroll handler
Content preloader
Progress tracker
Mobile touch gesture support

8. Additional features
8.1 For any spotify links, embed an iframe of the track

9. Background Transitions - have a dedicated css file/s for transitioning backgrounds as I scroll between pages


Would you like me to start implementing any specific part of this structure, or would you prefer to see a working example of one of these approaches?



Summary: Created Instagram-like Scrolling MVP for 300 Pages
I built a complete, ready-to-use website at C:\DEV\Project IO MVP with these key components:
Core Files Created:

index.html - Single-page app with smooth scrolling, progress bar, navigation controls
css/styles.css - Instagram-like dark theme with gradients, animations, mobile-responsive
js/script.js - Navigation logic with keyboard/touch controls, smooth scrolling between pages
build.js - Node.js script that combines multiple page files into single HTML
content/ folder - Where you put individual page files (page1.html, page2.html, etc.)
Sample pages - 3 demo pages showing different content types

Key Features Implemented:

✅ Smooth vertical scrolling between full-screen pages
✅ Progress bar and page counter (1/300)
✅ Keyboard navigation (arrows, spacebar, home/end)
✅ Touch gestures for mobile (swipe up/down)
✅ Navigation buttons with disabled states
✅ Responsive design for all screen sizes
✅ No external dependencies (pure HTML/CSS/JS)

How to Use:

Test demo: Open index.html in browser
Add content: Put your page files as page1.html, page2.html, etc. in content/ folder
Build: Run node build.js to combine all pages
Result: Single-file website with Instagram-like scrolling through all 300 pages

Architecture Choice:
Chose simple pre-loaded SPA approach over complex dynamic loading because with only 300 pages, loading everything upfront provides instant navigation without API complexity - perfect for MVP.
