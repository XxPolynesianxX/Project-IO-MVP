High-Level Architecture
1. Core Structure

Create a main navigation system that loads content dynamically
Use either a Single Page Application (SPA) approach or multiple interconnected HTML pages
Implement smooth scrolling transitions between content sections

2. Content Organization

Create numbered page components (page1.html, page2.html, etc.)
Each page should contain enough content to fill the viewport
Include engaging content (text, images, videos, interactive elements)

3. Navigation System

Add "Next" and "Previous" buttons/links
Implement infinite scroll detection when user reaches bottom of page
Create a progress indicator showing current position in the sequence

4. Technical Implementation Options
Option A: Multi-Page Approach

Separate HTML files for each page
Use JavaScript to preload next page content
Implement smooth page transitions with CSS animations

Option B: Single Page App

One HTML file with multiple content sections
JavaScript to show/hide sections dynamically
Smooth scrolling between sections

5. Essential Features

Responsive design for mobile doom-scrolling
Fast loading times with lazy loading for images/videos
Keyboard navigation (arrow keys, spacebar)
URL routing to allow direct linking to specific pages

6. File Structure
Project IO MVP/
├── index.html (main entry point)
├── css/
│   └── styles.css
├── js/
│   └── script.js
├── pages/
│   ├── page1.html
│   ├── page2.html
│   └── ...
└── assets/
    ├── images/
    └── media/
7. Key JavaScript Functions Needed

Page navigation controller
Smooth scroll handler
Content preloader
Progress tracker
Mobile touch gesture support

Would you like me to start implementing any specific part of this structure, or would you prefer to see a working example of one of these approaches?
